
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--It creates an empty git repository. You need to do it for version control and to be able to create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? --The staging area gets files ready to be added to the commit, the working directory is a collection of the files

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? --You can put the files you changed into the staging area before commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help? --When you have experiments or different versions of the project, while still keeping the master version the same
